This portfolio includes two key projects:

### 1. DnA Project

A modern, single-page website for a conceptual scientific communication initiative. It features a clean design built with HTML and inline CSS, focusing on a straightforward user experience.

An eco-themed landing page designed for a fictional environmental startup. This project demonstrates responsive design using Flexbox, CSS animations, and a structured layout to present the organization's mission and projects.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/gcangemi1997-coder/gcangemi1997-coder.github.io.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd gcangemi1997-coder.github.io
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

The main styles are written in SCSS and are located in `src/scss/global.scss`. If you wish to modify the styles, you will need a Sass compiler to transpile the `.scss` file into the final `dist/css/global.css` file.
